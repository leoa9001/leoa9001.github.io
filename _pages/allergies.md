I have numerous allergies, food intolerances (Celiac), and food sensitivities that I get questions about. Hopefully this reference helps out. 

**Short List**: Peanuts, tree nuts, legumes (beans, peas, chickpeas, etc), soy, and gluten I can not have. Peanuts are the worst. Soy lecithin is fine and soybean oil is usually fine. “Processed in the same facility as” or "May contain" warnings are fine. I also avoid red meat, and too oily/sugary/spicy due to stomach sensitivities.  

#### Allergies:
- Peanuts: Peanut protein is the problem; peanut oil is fine. Anaphylactic. “May contain peanuts” is also fine. 
- Tree nuts. Note: coconut is not included as it is not a tree nut
- Soy. Soy protein. Soy Lecithin is fine. Almost all gluten free soy sauce is fine.
- Legumes: peas, lentils, etc.

#### Serious Food Avoidance**
Gluten: Celiac’s disease; can have some every couple months but should not have consistently. I generally avoid it entirely. Not worried about cross contamination and (very) small amounts of gluten are ok. 

#### Minor Food Avoidance**:
- Bananas: Also some other fruits in the Spring/Summer. If certain tree pollens are active (e.g. Birch) then I have some minor allergies to fruit (they will only cause some temporary itching). If the fruit is cooked in any way, I will not be allergic to it in any season. I often have bananas in the Spring/Summer. Read: *do not worry about this.*
- Too spicy/sugary/fatty food. My stomach has become very sensitive over time :( 

#### Foods I specifically can eat that often people think I cant eat**:
- Dairy
- Eggs

**I can and often eat these**.
