I like mathematics and computer science. If you were around the Harvard mathematics department or MIT CSAIL 2016 - 2021 you might have seen me around. Since then, you probably have not seen me around as I have been sick with ME/CFS - a condition similar to severe long covid. Though, I have been a little more healthy/active lately. Most things interest me but among those, musical improvisation and educational projects stand out. 

You can find me at leo.c.alcock [at] gmail.com
