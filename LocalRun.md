## How to run locally:

Make sure to get into a local python environment with jupyter - there should be one. 
Probably by
`python3 -m venv .venv`  
`source .venv/bin/activate`
Then run
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
after in the environment. add `--future` if you want it to show future posts or `--drafts` to show drafts.
