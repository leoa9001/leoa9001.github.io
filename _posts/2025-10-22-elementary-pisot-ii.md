Part II Outline:
- Recall part I how noticed at the end it has a recurrence relation. 
- Then say, however notice following: show the recurrence relation, and note that all the sum powers of 
PV numbers satisfy recurrences and we can prove this with just single-variable calculus (and generating functions)
- spend rest of the time doing that. 
- End with talking about how this applies to a whole lot of numbers, Pisot (PV) numbers and give some examples recurrences and conjugates.
